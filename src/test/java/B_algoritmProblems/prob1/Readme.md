
 * Write a function that returns a List<String> of both pairs of numbers whose sum is the checksum from the 'inputs List' received as input.
 * If possible, write the function as an O(n) algorithm.
 * Number pairs should be written with the largest number in front ex) 14 = 10 + 4 ==> "10 4" ("4 10" X)
 * If there is only 7 in 'inputs', the pair of "7 7" is not valid
 * The input value is a non-overlapping V (Integer.MAX_VALUE >= N >= 0)
